# geoloc-map

The `geoloc-map` project is designed to provide a simple and flexible way to geolocate multiple objects based on a configuration file or environment variables. Each object is associated with a specific source from which its geolocation data is retrieved.

## Features

- **Configurable Sources**: Define multiple objects to geolocate using a configuration file or environment variables.
- **Interactive Maps**: Each object has its own interactive map displaying its geolocation data.
- **Easy Integration**: The maps can be seamlessly embedded into other websites as iframes.

## Use Case

This project is ideal for scenarios where you need to display geolocation data for multiple objects on individual maps, with the ability to integrate these maps into external web pages.

## How It Works

1. Configure the objects and their respective data sources using a configuration file or environment variables.
2. The application retrieves geolocation data for each object from the specified sources.
3. An interactive map is generated for each object.
4. The maps can be embedded into other websites using iframe tags.
